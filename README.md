# Home-Security-System
This was a final project for my LabVIEW class in which I designed a home security system using these modules: LCD, Sound sensor, RGB LED, 4x4 keypad, RFID-RC522, Piezo buzzer, servo motor and QR code.

I created front panels indicators for most of these hardwares to show it both through hardware and software.

NOTE: The Arduino code was not made by me. It was provided to me for my final project designed by another student tutoring the class.
